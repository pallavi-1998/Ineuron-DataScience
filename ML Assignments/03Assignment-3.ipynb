    "**Ans** The processes of Human learning are described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Under the supervision of experts:** Human-guided machine learning is a process whereby subject matter experts accelerate the learning process by teaching the technology in real-time. For example, if the machine learning model comes across a piece of data it is uncertain about, a human can be asked to weigh in and give feedback. The model then learns from this input, and uses it to make a more accurate prediction the next time. Human-guided machine learning works from the bottom up by first using algorithms to conduct the heavy lifting of identifying relationships within the data, and engaging humans when necessary for training or validation **Concept Learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**With the assistance of experts in an indirect manner:** Well The process of an algorithm learning from the training dataset can be thought of as a teacher supervising the learning process. We know the correct answers, the algorithm iteratively makes predictions on the training data and is corrected by the teacher. Learning stops when the algorithm achieves an acceptable level of performance **Operant Conditioning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Self education:** Ability to recognize patterns, learn from data, and become more intelligent over time (can be AI or programmatically based).Machine Learning: AI systems with ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed via training **Hebbian Learning**."

    "**Ans** Machine Learning probably can run into all problems for solving but lays down with some concerns which are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethics:** The idea of trusting data and algorithms more than our own judgment has its pros and cons. Obviously, we benefit from these algorithms, otherwise, we wouldn’t be using them in the first place. These algorithms allow us to automate processes by making informed judgments using available data. Sometimes, however, this means replacing someone’s job with an algorithm, which comes with ethical ramifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deterministic Problem:** Machine learning is stochastic, not deterministic. A neural network does not understand Newton’s second law, or that density cannot be negative — there are no physical constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lack of Data:** Many machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data before they begin to give useful results. Having a lack of good features can cause your algorithm to perform poorly, having a lack of good ground truth data can also limit the capabilities of your model."

    "2. **Preparing Data** : Cleaning the data to remove unwanted data, missing values, rows, and columns, duplicate values, data type conversion, etc. You might even have to restructure the dataset and change the rows and columns or index of rows and columns. Also, visualize the data.               \n",

    "3. **Choosing a model**: model determines the output you get after running a machine learning algorithm on the collected data. It is important to choose a model which is relevant to the task at hand. \n",
    "4. **Training the model** :  pass the prepared data to your machine learning model to find patterns and make predictions. It results in the model learning from the data so that it can accomplish the task set. Over time, with training, the model gets better at predicting. \n",
    "5. **Evaluating the model** :  testing the performance of the model on previously unseen data. The unseen data used is the testing set that you split our data into earlier. If testing was done on the same data which is used for training, you will not get an accurate measure, as the model is already used to the data, and finds the same patterns in it, as it previously did. This will give you disproportionately high accuracy.                         \n",
    "When used on testing data, you get an accurate measure of how your model will perform and its speed.\n",
    "6. **Parameter Tuning** : After evaluation of model, checking if its accuracy can be improved in any way. This is done by tuning the parameters present in your model. Parameters are the variables in the model that the programmer generally decides. At a particular value of your parameter, the accuracy will be the maximum. Parameter tuning refers to finding these values.\n",
    "7. **Making Predictions** : In the end, you can use your model on unseen data to make predictions accurately."

The benefits of deep learning in healthcare are plentiful – fast, efficient, accurate – but they don’t stop there.
