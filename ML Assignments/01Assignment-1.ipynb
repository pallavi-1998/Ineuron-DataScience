    "**Ans** - Machine Learning is a brannch of AI (Artificial Intelligence) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting output without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning use historical data as input to predict new output.                           \n",

    "1. **`Image Recognition`**: Image recognition is one of the most common applications of machine learning. It is used to identify objects, persons, places, digital images, etc. The popular use case of image recognition and face detection is **Automatic friend tagging suggestion**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`Speech Recognition`**:  While using Google, we get an option of Search by voice, it comes under speech recognition, and it's a popular application of Machine Learning. Speech recognition is a process of converting voice instructions into text, and it is also known as Speech to text, or Computer based speech recognition At present, machine learning algorithms are widely used by various applications of speech recognition. Google assistant, Siri, Cortana, and Alexa are using speech recognition technology to follow the voice instructions.\n",

    "3. **`Language Translation`**: Machine learning plays a significant role in the translation of one language to another. The technology behind the translation tool is called ‘machine translation.’ It has enabled people to interact with others from all around the world; without it, life would not be as easy as it is now. It has provided confidence to travelers and business associates to safely venture into foreign lands with the conviction that language will no longer be a barrier. Example is google translation.\n",
